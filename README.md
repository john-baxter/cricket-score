TODO
Add more user stories for more features like recording wickets, recording extras (breaking the extras count into categories is a possibility), displaying the number of overs played/remaining, displaying the innings run rate and/or the average run rate in the last x overs, displaying required runs/run rate for chasing team, automatically ending innings when 10 wickets are down, changing the duration of each innings (individually?) to account for rain-affected games, setting a DLS target for chasing team, expressing the result as `team` won by `xxx runs`/`y wickets`, amend errors/decrement if runs added incorrectly.
